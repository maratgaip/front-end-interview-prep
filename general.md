Knowledge of cross-browser testing.

Explain how you would ensure that your web design is user-friendly and what kinds of steps would you use?

Explain what is clear?
* A clear is utilized when you don’t need an element to wrap around another element, such as a float

What is a callback function?

* A callback function is utilized to limit this from happening because it is not called until the previous line of code has thoroughly executed.

How do you structure your source code


Explain what is the difference between Class and Prototypal inheritance?
* Inheritance in JavaScript is different from most other programming languages. The object system in JavaScript is prototype based, not class based. Objects in JavaScript are just a collection of a name (key) and value pairs. When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Every object has a private property which contains a link to another object called its prototype.

Can you explain the difference between visibility:hidden; and display:none?

* Visibility:Hidden; – It is not visible but gets up it’s original space.
* Display:None; – It is hidden and takes no space.

Explain what are the difference between Get and Post?

* A GET request is generally used for things like AJAX calls to an API, whereas a POST request is typically utilized to store data in a database or submit data through a form.

* GET requests are limited secure and can be viewed by the user in the URL, whereas POST requests are used in two steps and are not seen by the user. So, POST requests are more secure.

Describe what is the difference between Null and Undefined?

* Null is an object with no value.
* Undefined is a type.
* typeof null; // “object”
* typeof undefined; // “undefined”

Explain the importance of the HTML DOCTYPE?

* DOCTYPE is an instruction to the web browser regarding what version of the markup language the page is written. The DOCTYPE declaration need to be the pretty first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag. Doctype declaration points to a Document Type Definition (DTD). It provides markup language rules, so a browser can interpret the content correctly.

Explain the difference between cookies, session storage, and local storage?

* Cookies allow applications to store data in a client’s browser. 
* Session storage property allows applications to store data until the window is closed. 
* Local storage property lets applications to store data without an end.

Explain what is lazy loading?

* Lazy loading is a design pattern generally utilized in computer programming to delay initialization of an object until the period at which it is required. It can contribute to performance in the program’s operation if correctly and properly utilized. Besides, it is a loading code only once the user needs it. For instance, there is a button on the page, which reveals a different layout once the user pressed it. Hence, there is no necessary to load code for that layout on initial page load.


Explain the difference between classes and IDs?

* Classes and ID selectors, both are utilized as hooks for CSS styles. The ID’s are commonly used to style elements that only look once on a page, such as one instance of a navigational menu. The Classes are utilized to style different elements in the same fashion, such as the presence of links.

Explain what is Event Delegation?

* Event delegation points to the process of using event propagation to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It enables you to avoid adding event listeners to particular nodes; instead, you can add a single event listener to a parent element.

How can you increase page performance?

* Clean up the HTML document.
* Reduce external HTTP requests.
* Sprites, compressed images, smaller images.
* Incorporate JavaScript at the bottom of the page.
* Minify CSS, JavaScript, HTML.
* CDN and Caching.

What is Ajax?

* AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows applications to transport data to/from a server asynchronously without refreshing the page. This means that it is likely to update parts of a web page, without reloading the entire page. For instance, your new Gmail messages arrive and are marked as new even if you have not refreshed the web page.


What is the difference between Block, Inline,  Inline-block, and Box-sizing?

* Inline is the default. For example: An inline element is <span>.
* Block shows as a block element, such as `<div>` or `<p>`.
* Inline-block shows an element as an inline-level block container.
* Box-sizing displays the browser sizing properties.


What is Event Bubbling?

* Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the deepest target element. It causes all events in the child nodes to be automatically passed to its parent nodes. The advantage of this method is speed because the code only requires to traverse the DOM tree once.

Explain what is a Closure?

* A closure is a sequence of a function bundled together with references to its enclosing state. It gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. When a function renders a function, that is when the concept of closures becomes more consistent. The rendered function has access to variables that are not in the global scope, but they individually exist in its closure.

Explain how do you deal with browser-specific style incompatibility?

* There are multiple ways to operate about this. According, the simple way to proceed would be to utilize a conditional statement in the head tag of your HTML. In this way, you can recognize the browser and load an external stylesheet.

* Can you explain what server- versus client-side rendering is? What are the pros and cons of each?
* What is the difference between a GET and a POST? Which is more secure?
    * GET is passed in the URL and is easily modified. POST can also be modified but is more difficult for the casual user.
    * GET URLs can be passed around by a malicious party
* What is AJAX? What are some ways to perform async operations in Javascript?
